# Maybe-its-life
- Even if you know the glorious sun will not rise tomorrow, 
- Even if the bright moon sinks beneath the sea, 
- Even if you foresee the trends of the world, 
- Even if the end turns everything to ashes, 

You will never lose heart, and you will face it all with unwavering determination and indomitable spirit.

***This repository is used to document some study notes and reflections on life. Wish me luck!***
